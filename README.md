# hello-world
My first repository.
My name is Gabriel. I'm just learning the basics of programming. I built my first computer when I was 10, but I was always more interested in the hardware of the computer. I've reached a point now where I've really grown to appreciate the application of software, and the possibilities that arise when you properly marry hardware and software. I'd like to build data aggregation systems, and then analyze and visualize the data that those systems record. This will take a combination of front end design with java or another alternative as well as a deep understanding of a php or python framework, and a complex python or R based machine learning system. Making each of those independetly will be incredibly difficult, but making them all work in unison will be a tremendous achievement. What I really want to build is a system that, with operator assistance, captures, aggregates and analyzes video, audio, and text, and then displays those results via a smooth and functional interface.
